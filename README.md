# GraphicsEngine

This is a macOS implementation of a basic OpenGL graphics engine in C++. It supports different materials, lighting (no shadows), model loading, scene hierarchy, 3D transformations, and component systems.

This project aims to show a structure of a typical graphics/game engine. It may not run on some machines and serves mostly for code demonstration purposes.

Main.cpp contains the example code for a simple scene setup with 2 objects (one is the parent object of the other one). It also shows how transformations (in this case rotation) can be applied to any object in the scene.
